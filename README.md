You are hired by Air Nowhere to recommend the optimal overbooking rate. It is a small airline that uses a 100-seat plane to carry you from Seattle to, well, nowhere. The tickets cost $100 each, so a fully booked plane generates $10,000 revenue. The sales team has found that the probability, that the passengers who have paid their fare actually show up is 98%, and individual show-ups can be considered independent. The additional costs, associated with finding an alternative solutions for passengers who are refused boarding are $500 per person.
